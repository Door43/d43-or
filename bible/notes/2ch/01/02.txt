\v 2-5 When David had been king, he arranged for a new sacred tent to be made in Jerusalem. Then David and the Israelite leaders brought God's sacred chest from the city of Kiriath Jearim to the new sacred tent. But when Solomon became the king, the first sacred tent was still in the city of Gibeon. That was the tent that Moses, who had been a servant of God, had commanded to be made in the wilderness. The bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur, had made was also still at Gibeon, in front of the first sacred tent.
\p One day Solomon summoned the army commanders of one thousand soldiers and the commanders of one hundred soldiers, with the judges and all the other leaders in Israel. He told them to go with him to Gibeon. So they all went to the shrine at Gibeon where the sacred tent was, and Solomon and all the others with him worshiped Yahweh there.

\v 2 Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathersâ€™ houses.
\v 3 So Solomon and all the assembly with him went to the shrine  that was at Gibeon; for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses, the servant of Yahweh, had made in the wilderness.
\v 4 But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to
the place that he had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
\v 5 In addition, the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh; Solomon and the assembly went to it.
