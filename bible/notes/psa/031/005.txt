===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Into your hands I entrust my spirit** - AT: "so I put myself into your care" (UDB) or "I depend on you to take care of me." (See: [[:or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]] and [[:or:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **I hate those who serve worthless idols** - "Idols are worthless. I hate those who serve them." In some languages "worthless idols" is confusing. (See: tA adjective)
  * **you have seen my affliction ... you have known the distress of my soul** - Both of these phrases express the idea that God knows about the writer's troubles. (See: [[:or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
