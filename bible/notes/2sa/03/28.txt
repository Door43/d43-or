\v 28 Later, after David heard what had happened, he said, "Yahweh knows that I and the people of my kingdom are not at all responsible for\f + \ft Or: guilty of \f* murdering \f + \ft metonymy \f* Abner.
\v 29 I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that Joab and all his family will be punished \f + \ft metonymy \f* for doing this! I hope\f + \ft Or: desire \f* that there will always be someone in his family who has sores, or someone who is a leper, or some man who is forced to do women's work, or someone who is killed in a battle, or someone who does not have enough food to eat!"

\v 30 That is how Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.

\v 28 When David heard about this he said, "I and my kingdom are innocent before Yahweh forever regarding the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
\v 29 Let the guilt of Abner's death fall on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house. May there never  fail to be in the family of Joab someone who has a flowing sore or skin disease or who is lame and must walk with a staff or who is killed by the sword or who goes without food." 
\v 30 So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in battle.
