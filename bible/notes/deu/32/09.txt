===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **Jacob is his apportioned inheritance -  ** Jacob is the same as the people of Israel because they all descended from Jacob. (See: [[:or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]) AT: "The descendents of Jacob is the lot of his inheritance"
  * **He found him in a desert land and in the barren howling wilderness; he shielded him and cared for him - **  This is the beginning of a metaphor in which Moses compares the people of Israel to a man in a desert, a place without hope, food or water. This means that Yahweh took care of the people of Israel throughout their years in the desert, after they had left Egypt. (See: [[:or:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **he guarded him as the apple of his eye - **  The apple of an eye refers to the dark part inside of the eyeball that allows a person to see. This is a very important and sensitive part of the body. This phrase is used to say that the people of Israel are very important to God and something he protects. (See: [[:or:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]]) AT: “He protected the people of Israel as something most valuable and precious.”
