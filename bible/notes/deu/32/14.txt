Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses continues to compare the people of Israel to a man. (See: [[:or:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]) He describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.
