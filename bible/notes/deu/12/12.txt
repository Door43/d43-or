  * **rejoice before Yahweh** - "rejoice in the presence of Yahweh"
  * **the Levites who are within your gate** - The tribe of Levi did not receive a portion of land because Yahweh was to be their inheritance. Here "gate" refers to the towns or cities where the Levites lived. (See: [[:or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
