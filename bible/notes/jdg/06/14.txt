===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Yahweh looked at him** - "Yahweh looked at Gideon"
  * **Have I not sent you?** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he has sent Gideon to defeat the Midianites and will cause Gideon to be victorious. (See: [[or:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) 
  * **Please, Lord** - "Please understand my concerns, Lord"  Gideon now realizes that he is speaking with Yahweh so the word "Lord" has a different meaning.
  * **See** - To understand something is often described as being able to see it. AT: "Understand"
