\v 14 I was appointed to be the governor of Judea in the twentieth year that Artaxerxes was the king \add of Persia\add*. From that time until the thirty-second year, during those twelve years neither I nor my officials accepted \add the money that we were\add* allowed\f + \ft Or: entitled \f* to receive to buy food because of my being the governor.
\v 15 The men who were governors before I became the governor had burdened the people by requiring them to pay a lot of taxes. They had forced each person to pay to them 40 silver coins every day, in addition to giving food and wine to them. Even their servants\f + \ft Or: officials \f* oppressed the people. But I did not do that, because I had an awesome respect for God.

\v 14 So from the time I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the food provided for the governor.
\v 15 But the former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people, and took from them forty shekels of silver for their daily food and wine. Even their servants oppressed the people. But I did not do so because of the fear of God.

===== Translation Notes: =====

(See: [[or:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])

  * **twentieth year until the thirty-second year of Artexerxes the king** - Years in the ancient Near East were measured by the year of a king's reign.
  * **twelve years** - Nehemiah is restating the number of years for emphasis. AT: "during that entire time"
  * **neither I nor my brothers ate the food provided for the governor** - "Neither my brothers nor I ate the food provided for the governor." This food was provided by the king and was part of what a governor was paid by the people. Because the people were starving, Nehemiah chose not to make use of this privilege.
  * **former governors** - "previous governors" or "governors from the past" Nehemiah was not the first governor of Judah. 
  * **took from them forty shekels of silver for their daily food and wine** - AT: "from them forty shekels of silver in addition to daily food and wine." 
  * **shekel** - (See: [[:or:obe:other:biblicalmoney|biblical money]] and [[:or:obe:other:biblicalweight|biblical weight]])
