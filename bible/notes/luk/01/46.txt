===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **My soul…my spirit**  – These could be translated as "Oh how I" or "how I" which express deep emotion. (See: [[or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]]) Mary is using a form of poetry where she states the same thing in two slightly different ways. Both "soul" and "spirit" refer to the spiritual part of a person. She is saying that her worship comes from deep inside her. If possible, translate these with two slightly different words or phrases that have that similar meaning. (See: [[or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **exalts**  – "highly honors" or "greatly praises"
  * **rejoices in**  – “feels very joyful about” or “is very happy about”
  * **God my Savior**  – “God, the One who saves me” or “God who saves me”
