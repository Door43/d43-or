\v 39 They went outside of Gedor \add town\add* on the east side of the valley to look for pastureland for their flocks of sheep.
\v 40 They found good pastureland with plenty of grass. The place was peaceful and quiet.
\p Previously the descendants of \add Noah's son\add* Ham had lived there.
\v 41 But while Hezekiah was the king of Judah, those leaders of the tribe of Simeon came to Gedor and fought against the descendants of Ham and destroyed their tents. They also fought against the descendants of Meun who were living there and they killed all of them. So now there are no descendants of Meun living there. The descendants of Simeon started to live there, because there was good pastureland there for their sheep.

\v 39 They went to just outside of Gedor, on east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.
\v 40 They found abundant  and good pasture. The land was broad, quiet, and peaceable. The Hamites had formerly lived there.

\v 41 These just listed by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and attacked the Hamite settlements and the Meunim, who were there also. They destroyed them completely and  lived there because they found  pasture for their flocks.
