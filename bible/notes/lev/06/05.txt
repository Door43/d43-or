\v 5 You must not only return anything like that to its owner, but you must also pay to the owner one-fifth of its value.
\v 6 You must also bring to the priest a ram to be an offering to Yahweh in order that you will no longer be guilty. The ram that you bring must be one that has no defects, one that has the value that has been officially determined.
\v 7 Then the priest will offer that ram to be a sacrifice that will cause you to no longer be guilty, and you will be forgiven for the wrong things that you did."
