===== Translation Notes: =====
Yahweh is speaking in poetry. (See: [[or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
  * **he has completely destroyed them, he has handed them over to the slaughter** - Often prophets speak of things that will happen in the future as if they have already happened. This emphasizes the event will certainly happen. AT: "he will completely destroy them, he will give them over to the slaughter."
