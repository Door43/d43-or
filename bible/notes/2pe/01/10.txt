===== Translation Notes: =====
Peter continues to talk to the believers.

  * **Therefore**  - The word "therefore" begins the response of the believer to what was previously stated.
  * **make your calling and election sure for yourselves** - "calling" refers to the general invitation of salvation by God to the all people. "election" refers to the specific people that God has chosen. These two words have similar meaning. (See: [[:or:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])  
  * **you will not stumble** - You will not fail morally or spiritually.
