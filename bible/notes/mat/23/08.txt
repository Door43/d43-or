\v 9 Do not \add honor anyone\add* on earth \add by\add* addressing him as 'Father', because God, your Father in heaven, is the only \add spiritual\add* father of all of you.
\v 10 Do not \add allow people to\add* call you 'Instructors', because I, the Messiah, am the one instructor who\add teaches all of\add* you.

\v 8 But you, my disciples, should not allow people to call you 'Teacher,' as they do other Jewish teachers. I am the only one who is really your teacher. This means that you are all equal to each other, like brothers and sisters.
\v 9 Do not honor anyone on earth by addressing him as 'Father,' because God, your Father in heaven, is your only true father.
\v 10 Do not allow people to call you 'teacher,' because I, the Christ, am your only teacher.
