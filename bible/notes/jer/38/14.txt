\v 14 Then King Zedekiah sent word and brought Jeremiah the prophet to himself, to the third entrance in Yahweh's house. The king said to Jeremiah, “I want to ask you 
something. Do not keep the answer from me.”
\v 15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I answer you, will you not certainly kill me? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”
\v 16 But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in private and said, “As Yahweh lives, the one who made us, I will not kill you or give you into the hand of those men who are seeking your life.”
