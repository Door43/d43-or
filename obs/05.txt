କିଣାନକୁ ଆସି ୧୦ ବର୍ଷ ବିତି ଯିବା ପରେ ମଧ୍ୟ ଆବ୍ରାମ ଓ ଶରୀଙ୍କର ସନ୍ତାନ ଜନ୍ମ ହୋଇ ନ ଥିଲା। ତେଣୁ ସାରି ଆବ୍ରାମଙ୍କୁ କହିଲେ , “ ପରମେଶ୍ଵର ମତେ ଛୁଆ ଦେବାକୁ ନିବାରଣ କରିଥିବା କାରଣରୁ, ଏଠାରେ ହାଗର ଅଛନ୍ତି  ଦେଖନ୍ତୁ । ତେଣୁ ତାଙ୍କ ସହିତ ବିବାହ କରନ୍ତୁ । ସେ ମୋ ନିମନ୍ତେ ଛୁଆ ଜନ୍ମ କରିବେ ।

ତେଣୁ ଆବ୍ରାମ ହାଗରଙ୍କୁ ବିବାହ କରିଲେ । ହାଗରଙ୍କର ଏକ ପୁତ୍ର ସନ୍ତାନ ହେଲା ଓ ତାଙ୍କୁ ଇସମାଏଲ ନାମ ଦେଲେ । କିନ୍ତୁ ସାରି ହାଗରଙ୍କ ପ୍ରତି ଈର୍ଷା କରିଲେ । ଯେତେବେଳେ ଇସମାଏଲଙ୍କୁ ୧୩ ବର୍ଷ ହେଲା ପୁନର୍ବାର ପରମେଶ୍ଵର ଆବ୍ରାମଙ୍କୁ କହିଲେ

ପରମେଶ୍ଵର କହିଲେ, “ ମୁଁ ସର୍ବ ଶକ୍ତିମାନ ଇଶ୍ଵର ଅଟେ । “ ତୁମ ସହିତ ମୁଁ ଏକ ନିୟମ ସ୍ଥିର କରିବି । ତେବେ ଆବ୍ରାମ ଭୂମିଷ୍ଠ ପ୍ରଣାମ କରିଲେ । ପରମେଶ୍ଵର ମଧ୍ୟ ଆବ୍ରାମଙ୍କୁ କହିଲେ, “ତୁମେ ଅନେକ ଦେଶର ପିତା ହେବ । “ ମୁଁ ତୁମକୁ ଓ ତୁମବଂଶଧରଙ୍କୁ କିଣାନ ଦେଶ ଦେବି, ସେମାନେ ଏଥିରେ ବାସ କରିବେ । ମୁଁ  ଚିରଦିନ ପାଇଁ ସେମାଙ୍କର ଇଶ୍ଵର ରହିବି । ତୁମ ପରିବାରର ପ୍ରତ୍ୟେକ ସନ୍ତାନମାନଙ୍କୁ ସୁନ୍ନତ କରିବ ।

"Your wife, Sarai, will have a son—he will be the son of promise. Name him Isaac. I will make my covenant with him, and he will become a great nation. I will make Ishmael a great nation, too, but my covenant will be with Isaac." Then God changed Abram's name to Abraham, which means "father of many." God also changed Sarai's name to Sarah, which means "princess."

That day Abraham circumcised all the males in his household. About a year later, when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, Sarah gave birth to Abraham's son. They named him Isaac as God had told them to do.

When Isaac was a young man, God tested Abraham's faith by saying, "Take Isaac, your only son, and kill him as a sacrifice to me." Again Abraham obeyed God and prepared to sacrifice his son.

As Abraham and Isaac walked to the place of sacrifice, Isaac asked, "Father, we have wood for the sacrifice, but where is the lamb?" Abraham replied, "God will provide the lamb for the sacrifice, my son."

When they reached the place of sacrifice, Abraham tied up his son Isaac and laid him on an altar. He was about to kill his son when God said, "Stop! Do not hurt the boy! Now I know that you fear me because you did not keep your only son from me."

Nearby Abraham saw a ram that was stuck in a bush. God had provided the ram to be the sacrifice instead of Isaac. Abraham happily offered the ram as a sacrifice.

Then God said to Abraham, "Because you were willing to give me everything, even your only son, I promise to bless you. Your descendants will be more than the stars in the sky. Because you have obeyed me, all the families of the world will be blessed through your family."
