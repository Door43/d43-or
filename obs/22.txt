ପୂର୍ବେ, ଈଶ୍ବର ତାହାଙ୍କ ଲୋକମାନଙ୍କୁ ତାହାଙ୍କ ଦୂତଗଣ ଏବଂ ଭାବବାଦୀମାନଙ୍କ ଦ୍ବାରା କଥା କହିଅଛନ୍ତି । କିନ୍ତୁ 400 ବର୍ଷ ବିତିଗଲା ଯେତେବେଳେ କି ସେ ସେମାନଙ୍କୁ କଥା କହିଲେ ନାହିଁ । ହଠାତ୍‍ଜଣେ ଦୂତ ଈଶ୍ବରଙ୍କଠାରୁ ଏକ ବାର୍ତ୍ତା ନେଇ ଜିଖରିୟ ନାମକ ଏକ ବୃଦ୍ଧଙ୍କ ନିକଟକୁ ଆସିଥିଲେ । ଜିଖରିୟ ଓ ତାଙ୍କ ସ୍ତ୍ରୀ ଇଲିଶାବେଥ ଈଶ୍ବର ପରାୟଣ ଲୋକ ଥିଲେ, କିନ୍ତୁ ସେ ସନ୍ତାନ ଧାରଣ କରିବା ନିମନ୍ତେ ଅକ୍ଷମ ଥିଲେ ।

ଦୂତ ଜିଖରିୟଙ୍କୁ କହିଲେ “ତୁମ ସ୍ତ୍ରୀ ଏକ ପୁତ୍ର ସନ୍ତାନକୁ ଜନ୍ମ ଦେବ । ତୁମେ ତାହାଙ୍କୁ ଯୋହନ ବୋଲି ନାମ ଦେବ । ସେ ପବିତ୍ର ଆତ୍ମାରେ ପରିପୂର୍ଣ୍ଣ ହେବେ ଏବଂ ମଶୀହଙ୍କ ନିମନ୍ତେ ଲୋକମାନଙ୍କୁ ପ୍ରସ୍ତୁତ କରିବେ । ଜିଖରିୟ ଉତ୍ତର ଦେଲେ “ମୁଁ ଓ ମୋ ସ୍ତ୍ରୀ ଏତେ ବୃଦ୍ଧ ଅଟୁ ଯେ ସନ୍ତାନ ଜନ୍ମ କରିବା ନିମନ୍ତେ ଆମେ ଅକ୍ଷମ ଅଟୁ! ଏହା ଘଟିବ ବୋଲି ମୁଁ କିପରି ଜାଣିବି?”

The angel responded to Zechariah, "I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born." Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah returned home and his wife became pregnant.

When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the same angel suddenly appeared to Elizabeth's relative, whose name was Mary. She was a virgin and was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph. The angel said, "You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You are to name him Jesus. He will be the Son of the Most High God and will rule forever."

Mary replied, "How can this be, since I am a virgin?" The angel explained, "The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will overshadow you. So the baby will be holy, the Son of God." Mary believed and accepted what the angel said.

Soon after the angel spoke to Mary, she went and visited Elizabeth. As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, Elizabeth's baby jumped inside her. The women rejoiced together about what God had done for them. After Mary visited Elizabeth for three months, Mary returned home.

After Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy, Zechariah and Elizabeth named the baby John, as the angel had commanded. Then God allowed Zechariah to speak again. Zechariah said, “Praise God, because he has remembered his people! You, my son, will be called the prophet of the Most High God who will tell the people how they can receive forgiveness for their sins!”
