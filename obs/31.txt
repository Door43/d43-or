ତା’ପରେ ଯୀଶୁ ତାହାଙ୍କ ଶିଷ୍ୟମାନଙ୍କୁ ନୌକାରେ ଚଢି ହ୍ରଦର ଆର ପାଖକୁ ଯିବା ପାଇଁ କହିଲେ ଯେତେବେଳେ କି ଜନତାକୁ ଛାଡିଗଲେ । ଯୀଶୁ ଜନତାକୁ ପଠାଇଦେଲା ପରେ, ସେ ପ୍ରାର୍ଥନା କରିବା ନିମନ୍ତେ ଏକ ପର୍ବତ ପାର୍ଶ୍ବକୁ ଗଲେ । ଯୀଶୁ ସେଠାରେ ଏକାକୀ ଥିଲେ, ଏବଂ ସେ ରାତି ପାହିବା ପର୍ଯ୍ୟନ୍ତ ସେଠାରେ ପ୍ରାର୍ଥନା କରିବାକୁ ଲାଗିଲେ ।

Meanwhile, the disciples were rowing their boat, but by late in the night they had only reached the middle of the lake. They were rowing with great difficulty because the wind was blowing hard against them.

Then Jesus finished praying and went to the disciples. He walked on top of the water across the lake toward their boat!

The disciples were very afraid when they saw Jesus, because they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knew that they were afraid, so he called out to them and said, "Do not be afraid. It is I!"

Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water." Jesus told Peter, "Come!"

So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after walking a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus and began to look at the waves and to feel the strong wind.

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink in the water. He cried out, "Master, save me!" Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, "You man of little faith, why did you doubt?"

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped blowing and the water became calm. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, "Truly, you are the Son of God."
